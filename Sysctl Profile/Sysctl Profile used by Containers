/* Explanation of how to configure and use kernal parameters withtin a Kubernetes Cluster using a Sysctl interface */
/*
Kernal Parameters: 
Kernel boot parameters are text strings which are interpreted by the system to change specific
behaviors and enable or disable certain features.

Kubernetes Cluster: 
"A set of node machines for running containerized applications. If you're running Kubernetes, 
you're running a cluster. At a minimum, a cluster contains a control plane and one or more compute machines, or nodes."

Sysctl Interface: 
A software utility of some Unix-like operating systems that reads and modifies the attributes of the 
system kernel such as its version number, maximum limits, and security settings. It is available both as a system call 
for compiled programs, and an administrator command for interactive use and scripting. Linux additionally exposes sysctl
as a virtual file system.
