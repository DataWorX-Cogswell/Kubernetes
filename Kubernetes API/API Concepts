 Kubernetes API is a "resource-based (RESTFUL) programmmatic interface provided via HTTP".
 - Supports retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting primary resources via the standard HTTP verbs (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE,GET), includes additional
 subresources for many objects that allow fine grained authorization (such as binding a pod to a node), and can accept and server those resources in different 
 representations for convenience or efficiency. It also supports efficient change notifications on resources via "watches" and consistent lists to allow other
 components to eddectively cache and sychronize the state of resources.
