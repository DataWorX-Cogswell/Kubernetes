 Target Port:
 *Target ports allow us to seperate the port the service is available on from the port the application is listening on.
 TargetPort is the port which the application is configuredto listen on. Port is how the application will be accessed 
 from the outside.
 
 //Similar to previously, the service and extra pods are deployed via:
 "kubectl apply -f clusterip-target.yaml"
 
 //Following commands create the service:
 "cat clusterip-target.yaml" //view 
 "kubectl get svc"
 "kubectl describe svc/webapp1-clusterip-targetport -svc"
 
 //After the service and pods have deployed, it can be accessed via the cluster IP as before,
 but this time on the defined port 8080.
 "export CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl get services/webapp1-clusterip-targetport -svc -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')"
 "echo CLUSTER_IP=$CLUSTER_IP"
 "curl $CLUSTER_IP:8080"

*This application itself is still configured to listen on port 80.
Kubernetes service manages the translation between the two.
