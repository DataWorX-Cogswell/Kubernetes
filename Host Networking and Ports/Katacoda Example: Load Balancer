*When running in the cloud, such as EC2 or Azur, its possible to configure and assign a public IP address issued via the cloud provider. 
This will be issued via a Load Balancer such as ELB. This allows additional public IP addresses to be allocated to a kubernetes cluster
without interacting directly with the cloud provider.

//As Katacoda is not a cloud provider, its still possible to dynamically allocate IP addresses to Load Balancer type services. This is 
done by deploying the cloud provider using:
"kubectl apply -f cloudprovider.yaml"

//Additional notes needed
